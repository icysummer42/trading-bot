**Technical Feasibility Assessment Framework:**

### 1. Implementation Complexity Analysis

**Complexity Scoring Methodology:**

```yaml
COMPLEXITY_ASSESSMENT:
  technical_factors:
    algorithm_complexity:
      simple: Basic calculations, standard libraries available
      moderate: Custom algorithms, some optimization needed
      complex: Novel algorithms, significant optimization required
      critical: Cutting-edge research, unproven approaches
    
    integration_complexity:
      simple: Well-documented APIs, standard protocols
      moderate: Multiple APIs, some custom adapters
      complex: Legacy systems, custom protocols
      critical: Undocumented systems, reverse engineering
    
    data_complexity:
      simple: Structured data, standard formats
      moderate: Multiple sources, normalization required
      complex: Unstructured data, complex transformations
      critical: Real-time streaming, microsecond latency
    
    performance_requirements:
      simple: Seconds latency acceptable
      moderate: Sub-second response needed
      complex: Millisecond latency required
      critical: Microsecond latency critical
```

### 2. Technology Stack Validation

**Stack Assessment for Your Options Trading Bot Implementation:**

```yaml
TECHNOLOGY_EVALUATION:
  python_ecosystem_reality_check:
    your_implementation_gaps:
      - ExecutionEngine is just print() statement - 12-16 weeks to production
      - No broker integration scaffolding - adds 4-6 weeks
      - Individual test scripts vs framework - technical debt accumulating
      - Sequential NLP processing in nlp_sentiment - bottleneck at scale
    
    finbert_specific_issues:
      - Your implementation processes texts sequentially in loop
      - No batch processing optimization
      - ~500ms per text on CPU, ~200ms on GPU
      - With 10 news sources, looking at 5+ second latency
      - No caching of sentiment scores for repeated text
    
    gil_implications_for_your_architecture:
      - Can't parallelize signal generation across symbols
      - Plugin system adds linear latency as plugins increase
      - Backtesting will be slow without multiprocessing refactor
      - Consider ProcessPoolExecutor for parallel symbol processing
  
  polygon_io_reality:
    your_free_tier_constraints:
      - 5 requests/minute for historical data
      - Your backtest needs ~20 requests per symbol
      - Testing 10 symbols = 40 minutes just for data fetching
      - CRITICAL: No options chains in free tier
      - Upgrade to $99/month tier essential for options trading
    
    missing_in_your_implementation:
      - No rate limit handling in polygon_client.py
      - No exponential backoff for failures
      - No request queuing system
      - No failover to alternate data source for options
  
  execution_gap_analysis:
    current_state: "print(trade)"
    production_requirements:
      - IB-insync integration: 4-6 weeks
      - Order state management: 2-3 weeks
      - Position tracking: 2-3 weeks
      - Multi-leg coordination: 3-4 weeks
      - Paper trading mode: 2 weeks
    total_realistic_timeline: 15-20 weeks for execution alone
```
