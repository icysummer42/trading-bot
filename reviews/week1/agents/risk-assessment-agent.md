### 2. Risk Scoring and Prioritization

**Risk Assessment Matrix:**

```markdown
| Risk ID | Category | Description | Probability | Impact | Score | Mitigation |
|---------|----------|-------------|-------------|--------|-------|------------|
| R-001 | Market | Flash crash scenario | Low | Critical | High | Circuit breakers |
| R-002 | Technical | API outage | Medium | High | High | Multiple providers |
| R-003 | Model | Overfitting | High | Medium | High | Cross-validation |
| R-004 | Operational | Fat finger | Medium | Critical | Critical | Limit checks |
```

**Risk Scoring Methodology:**
- Probability: Nearly Certain (5), Likely (4), Possible (3), Unlikely (2), Rare (1)
- Impact: Critical (5), Major (4), Moderate (3), Minor (2), Negligible (1)
- Risk Score = Probability × Impact
- Critical threshold: Score ≥ 20
- High threshold: Score ≥ 12
- Medium threshold: Score ≥ 6

### 3. Capital Preservation Focus

**Primary Risk Controls (Critical Implementation Gaps):**

Your current implementation has a significant gap between the basic 1% fixed position sizing in `RiskManager` and your planned Kelly Criterion approach. This is extremely dangerous because Kelly Criterion can suggest position sizes of 25% or more with high-confidence signals. Without proper caps, a single model error could destroy your capital. The immediate requirement is to implement position size limits regardless of what Kelly suggests - typically capping at 5-10% per position even with maximum confidence.

The complete absence of circuit breakers in your codebase represents a critical vulnerability. Your `aggregate_scores` method can produce extreme values if multiple plugins fire simultaneously or if there's a data anomaly. You need automatic trading halts when unusual conditions are detected, such as signal scores beyond normal ranges, too many trades in a short period, or excessive drawdown.

**Signal Aggregation Risk (Your Multi-Source Architecture):**

Your implementation aggregates signals from Reddit, NewsAPI, GNews, and Stocktwits, which creates a hidden correlation risk. When major news breaks, all these sources discuss the same event, and your current aggregation method could triple or quadruple count the same signal. This overconfidence could lead to oversized positions exactly when the market is most uncertain. You need correlation-adjusted aggregation that recognizes when multiple sources are discussing the same underlying event.

**Plugin System Risk (Unique to Your Architecture):**

Your event plugin system (`UnusualOptionsFlowPlugin`, `CyberSecurityBreachPlugin`, `TopTierReleasePlugin`) adds signals linearly to your aggregate score. This creates risk of score explosion when multiple plugins trigger simultaneously. For example, if unusual options flow coincides with a cyber breach announcement, your score could spike beyond reasonable bounds. Each plugin needs individual weight limits and the aggregate needs a ceiling function.

**Stress Testing Scenarios (Adapted for Your Strategies):**

Given your focus on iron condors and delta-neutral strategies, standard stress tests aren't sufficient. You need specific scenarios:
- Volatility expansion beyond expected move (iron condor max loss)
- Pin risk at expiration with underlying exactly at strike
- Early assignment on short legs during dividend periods
- Correlation breakdown in your multi-leg hedges
- API outage scenarios - what happens when Polygon.io fails during market hours?
- Signal generator failure - how does system behave with NaN scores?

### 4. Model Risk Assessment

**Validation Framework (Your ML Components):**

```yaml
MODEL_RISK_EVALUATION:
  finbert_sentiment:
    implementation_risk: Sequential processing bottleneck
    accuracy_concern: Financial text specific, may fail on options slang
    latency_impact: ~500ms per text batch on CPU
    fallback_strategy: OpenAI API when available, zero when unavailable
    
  garch_volatility:
    convergence_risk: Fails frequently during volatile periods
    fallback_ewma: Simple but may underestimate tail risk
    parameter_stability: p=1, q=1 may be insufficient for options
    validation_needed: Compare forecast vs realized volatility
    
  signal_aggregation:
    weight_risk: Hardcoded 0.6/0.4 weights lack adaptability
    plugin_stacking: Linear addition can cause score explosion
    correlation_blind: No adjustment for source correlation
    validation_gap: No backtesting of weight optimization
```

**Your Caching System Risks:**

The pickle-based caching in your `cache/` directory introduces specific model risks. Cached data includes historical prices that your models train on, and stale cache can make your backtesting results completely invalid. You're essentially testing on data that doesn't match reality. Cache invalidation must be triggered whenever you modify data pipeline logic, change date ranges, or update symbol lists. The risk is that developers may forget to clear cache when testing model changes, leading to false confidence in strategies that would fail with fresh data.
