### **🔥 Basic Rate-Limited Data Fetching**
```python
from complete_data_pipeline_with_rate_limiting import create_rate_limited_pipeline

# Create rate-limited pipeline
pipeline = create_rate_limited_pipeline(environment="production")

# Initialize async components
await pipeline.initialize_async()

# Fetch market data with automatic rate limiting
market_data = await pipeline.fetch_market_data_async("AAPL", provider="polygon")

# Fetch news data with medium priority
news_data = await pipeline.fetch_news_data_async("technology", provider="newsapi")

# Rate limiting automatically handled across all providers
```

### **⚡ Comprehensive Multi-Source Data Fetch**
```python
# Fetch data from all sources with coordinated rate limiting
comprehensive_data = await pipeline.comprehensive_data_fetch(
    symbols=["AAPL", "GOOGL", "MSFT", "TSLA", "SPY"],
    fetch_news=True,
    fetch_economic=True,
    fetch_weather=True,
    fetch_political=True
)

# Results include:
# - market_data: Rate-limited market data for all symbols
# - news_data: Prioritized news articles
# - economic_data: High-priority economic indicators  
# - weather_data: Low-priority weather alerts
# - _metadata: Performance metrics and timing
```

### **📊 Rate Limiting Monitoring**
```python
# Get real-time rate limiting status
rate_status = await pipeline.get_rate_limiting_status()
print(f"Overall status: {rate_status['overall_status']}")

# Get performance metrics
perf_metrics = await pipeline.get_performance_metrics()
for provider, metrics in perf_metrics["rate_limiting"].items():
    success_rate = metrics["success_rate"] * 100
    avg_time = metrics["average_response_time"]
    print(f"{provider}: {success_rate:.1f}% success, {avg_time:.3f}s avg")

# Comprehensive health check
health = await pipeline.health_check_comprehensive()
print(f"System health: {health['overall_status']}")
```
